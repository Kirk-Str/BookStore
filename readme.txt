*ABC Book Company*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABC Book Company is a bookstore with a single outlet. They require a computerized system that would handle their day-to-day operations of inventory.  Primary scope of this assignment is to provide a comprehensive solution that uses Object Oriented Programing concepts.

As part of my Uni project work, I have done this small application to tract book inventory in a simplest way possible. This application mainly records books and its meta informations such as title, short title, category, author, publisher and published date etc. 


It is a useful little project for anyone who is looking to build such application in Java 3-tier architecture with MySQL for their Uni Project.
